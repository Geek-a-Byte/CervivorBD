Cervical cancer is the 4th most common cancer among women worldwide and it is the 2nd most common cancer in Bangladesh. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, more than 50 million Bangladeshi women are at risk of developing cervical cancer.

In a recent survey for a group of females, only 64.4% of them had primary knowledge about cervical cancer. Most of them refused to take any screening test due to the possible reasons: lack of information about screening methods, fear of the result, shyness, fear of screening test, religious belief etc. 88.1% of them responded that they didn’t take any vaccines against HPV as well. For cervical cancer awareness, prediction and suggestion, 61% of them preferred an android app over a website.

As a result, we propose an android app named CervivorBD. A smart assistive system for cervical cancer patients. The app will be  developed in Bengali so that mass people in BD can be made aware of cervical cancer.

Features of the app :

## Prediction of Cervical Cancer using Machine Learning

- Initial Screening/Symptom testing through questionnaire, which would be collected by specialized doctors or by parsing medical records.
- Demographic data collection from suspected patients (age, location etc).
- Regular Habitual data collection from patients (smoking, alcohol intaking etc).

## Appointment Booking system

- Preferable time slots for doctor’s availability.
- Selecting specific date and time for patients to search for available doctors at that time.
- Selecting nearby area clinics for onsite visits.

## Follow up routine on patient’s private dashboard, results of checkup/diagnosis

- Private dashboards for patients, where they can see their prescriptions, medical records and next follow-up dates.
- As sensitive data would be collected, data privacy would be handled.

## Public forum/threads, threads can either be public or private

- Discussion threads would be made according to the patient's request, which will be opened by requested doctors.
- Discussion threads can be public/private depending on doctor-patient discussion.

## Preventive Measures/Awareness

- Social awareness about the causes of cervical cancer.
- More knowledge about screening tests, diagnosis of cervical cancer.
- Preventive measures which should be taken to avoid potential risks of cervical cancer.
- Posts and threads for the publicity of different mobile screening centers and their activities.

## Realtime survey result showcasing

- To assure people more about the usability, importance of this android app, survey forms would be provided and results of the data inputs would be shown on real time graphs.
- Showing results of the successful integration of AI, machine learning and other relevant domains in predicting and detecting cervical cancer which would be more helpful to gain credibility of the system.
